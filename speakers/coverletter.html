                <p>To Whom it May Concern:</p>

				<p>I am a junior at Rutgers University and I would like to be considered for your production team as an intern.
				I began working on professional sets as a production assistant as soon as I graduated high school and have gradually
				worked my way up to the position of camera operator over the last 3 years. I was drawn to The Late Night Showâ€™s Summer
				Internship because of the opportunity it offered to be a part of the production of a live show. My experience with working
				live shows is limited to theater and I would love to take the next step and work on a live television show.
				Because of my past experience and desire to learn more about production work, I believe this internship would be the proper
					next step for me in my career.</p>
				<p>I actually started my career as a production worker by getting coffee and lunch for the cast and crew
					of an indie web series called Dekalog. During my time as a production assistant on the show, I developed a good
					relationship with the director and he eventually offered to teach me how to operate the audio equipment.
					I became really excited and jumped at the chance to do so.
					After I had completed filming for the show, my reliability and skill allowed for me to be recommended to other productions.
					Today, 3 years later, I am doing camera work for a feature film.</p>
				<p>By letting me join the NBCUniversal family, you will not only get my years of experience on sets,
					but also my motivation and unparalleled dedication to anything I do. To put things into perspective:
					I have been just as proactive running for coffee as I was with running a sound system.
					I am sure that no matter what set I work on, I will always bring the same strong energy purely out of my love
					for working behind the scenes. I would be grateful if I could have the opportunity to bring this energy to NBCUniversal.</p>

				<p>Sincerely,</p>
